# basic-file-management

## Objective: Introduce learners to Python's os and shutil libraries for file manipulation.

### Activity Steps:

Create a Python script that:
Creates a folder named Automation_Folder.
Creates 5 text files (file1.txt, file2.txt, etc.) inside the folder.
Rename each file to include a timestamp (e.g., file1_2025-01-28.txt).
Move all .txt files to a subfolder called Processed_Files.
Delete all files older than a specific date.


## Expected Outcome: A working script that demonstrates file organisation and cleanup.
